        <p id="about">WHY IS CODING IMPORTANT To <b>Me</b>?
        </p>
       <p>Code powers our digital world. Every website, smartphone app, computer programme, calculator and even microwave relies on code in order to operate. This
           makes coders the architects and builders of the digital age.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the next 10 years it is estimated that there will be 1.4 million jobs in computer sciences and only around 400,000 graduates qualified to do them.
       </p>
       <p>
      Jobs not directly linked to computer sciences – such as banking, medicine and journalism – will also be affected by the need for at least an understanding of
         programming and coding.
        </p>
        <p>
         “Our world is increasingly run by software and we need more diversity in the people who are building it. More importantly, writing software is about
         expression, creativity – and practical application,” Liukas told IBTimes UK.
        </p>
         <p>
         “Our kids should learn to bend, join, break and combine code in a way it wasn’t designed to. It’s a whole generation of kids that will use code like our
          generation used words.”.
         </p>
          <p>I hope i can change the future by coding </p>
